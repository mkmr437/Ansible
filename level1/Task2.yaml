#Task 2: Run httpd package and Ansible inventory update

a. Create an ini type Ansible inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory on jump host.

b. Add App Server 2 in this inventory along with required variables that are needed to make it work.

c. The inventory hostname of host should be the server name as per wiki, for example stapp01 for app server 1 in Stratos DC.
